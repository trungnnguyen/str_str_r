1. Pre-requisites
  File format: Either the csv from the NIST, or MTS files.
  In the NIST case, def nist_inplane can be used.
  >>> from str_str_r import nist_inplane as ni
  >>> ni(ext ='*.csv', ifig=92, order=3, epsl=0.05, epsu=0.10, delt=10)

 2. Raw data file format
  NIST mode is assumed to have three lines of header.
  Example header as below:

Time,Extension,Load,Displacement (Strain 1),Displacement (Strain 2)
  (sec),(mm),(N),(mm),(mm)
  12.6, 1.2
  .
  .
  .
  The last row contains two numbers, each of which contains the width and the thickness, respectively.
