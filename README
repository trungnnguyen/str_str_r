Uniaxial Tensile Test Analyzer
==============================
 1. Introduction
  Uniaxial tensile test is one of the most widely conducted mechanical test for sheet metals.
  While the standard geometry of the tensile sample bar is widely accepted, it is difficult to find a consensus for post-analyzing method on the experimental data.
  Therefore, the experimental data can be subjective to the experimentalist who analyzes the data.    
 
 2. Cautions
  2-1. For a certain usage, the file name should be 'A_B_C.csv' such that each corresponds to label, angle (3digits) and duplication number, respectively. For example, 'Asteel_045_3.csv' is the third sample tensiled along 45 degree from RD of Asteel. This is a mandate if one wants to systematically analyze data set along a certain set of the in-plane directions from which the sample is cut off. In other word, if one wants to do a study with in-plane variation of certain physical terms, e.g., yield stress, r-value and so on, it is a good practice to strictly maintain such file name convention.
  2-2. If one wants to analyze a series of files, the incremental angle is decided to be angles[1] - angles[0].

 3. Manual
  Manual is very limited since I cannot afford to spending more time on documenting. It is written in HTML, thus embedding an Equation is not an easy task. However, manual should be self-explantory so that an end-user can use this software very easily. This software is not such one that users use it on a regular basis. Instead it is expected that a user has to remind him/herself how to use it every once in a while. Therefore, using the software should be very intuitive.
