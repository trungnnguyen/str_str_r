<h2> 1. Pre-requisites </h2>
<p> For the issues on file format, refer to chapter 2. </p>
<p> File format: Either the csv from the NIST, or MTS files.
  In the NIST case, def nist_inplane can be used. </p>
<i>
  >>> from str_str_r import nist_inplane as ni <br />
  >>> ni(ext ='*.csv', ifig=92, order=3, epsl=0.05,
  epsu=0.10, delt=10) <br />
</i>

<h2> 2. Raw data file format</h2>
<p> NIST mode is assumed to have three lines of header.
  Example header as below: </p>
<p> Time,Extension,Load,Displacement (Strain 1),
  Displacement (Strain 2) <br />
  (sec),(mm),(N),(mm),(mm) <br />
  12.6, 1.2 <br /> . <br /> . <br /> . <br />
</p>
<p> The last row contains two numbers,
  each of which contains the width and the thickness,
  respectively. </p>
