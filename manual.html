<h2>1. Introduction </h2>
<p> For the issues on file format, refer to chapter 2. </p>
<p> Currently, there are two formats available. One of which is called
  'MTS' while the other is 'NIST'. Ths module str_str_r.py is, at first,
  created for analyzing the raw data files from the MTS system at GIFT.
  Later on, to cope with the raw file for the raw data files from NIST,
  mode 'NIST' was added. During the stay at NIST, the incremental angle
  for in-plane tensile bar decided to be 15 degree, which eventually led to
  far more number of files for one kind of material. Therefore, a different
  way of post-processing the data was necessary. On the other hand, the
  forcus was on the the in-plane variations of the r-value and the yield
  stress. Therefore, some additional features were necessary to look at
  such features more intensely and, at the same time, succintly. Error
  bar was also necessary to see how experimental scatter is like, which
  provide a systematic view on the aspects of both experiments and and
  modeling.

<p> File format: Either the csv from the NIST, or MTS files.</p>

<h2>2. Prerequisites </h2>

<h3>2-1. Raw data file format</h3>

<h4> NIST </h4>
<p> First of all, the raw data file name should be stricly given as
  follows. The basic format of should be 'a_b_c.csv'. Each of the three
  a, b and c regions should be the material label, the three digits
  angle along which the sample is cut-off of, and the duplicate number,
  respectively. </p>
<p> NIST mode is assumed to have three lines of header. Example header
  as below: </p>
<p><font color='blue'> Time,Extension,Load,Displacement (Strain 1),
  Displacement (Strain 2) <br />
  (sec),(mm),(N),(mm),(mm) <br />
  12.6, 1.2 <br /> . <br /> . <br /> . <br />
</font></p>
<p> The last row contains two numbers, each of which contains the width
  and the thickness,  respectively. </p>
<p> It is assumed that the raw data file contains the time record, axial
  extension, load, and width displacement change. Both the axial extension
  and the width extension are assumed to be travel length so thus positive.</p>

<h5> MTS </h4>
<p> The mode, MTS, names after the MTS system at GIFT. MTS mode requires either axial strain(i.e. engineering strain) or axial displacement. It also needs either force or engineering stress. The width extension is a necessity to calculate R-value. Time is not a prerequisite but in such a case, one has to input the data acquisition rate. </p>

<h2>3. Important Modules</h2>
<p>  </p>

<h2>4. Usage in details </h2>

<h3>4.1 On a single file </h3>
<p> We can produce a bunch of data from a single raw data file.  </p>

<h3>4.2 On a single set of duplicates </h3>
<p> Often times one conducts two or more duplicates of the sample in order to
see how reliable the data is and to obtain the exprimental scatter. In such
a case, one may want to analyze the mean values of the duplicates together with
errorbar. </p>

<h3>4.3 On a series of files </h3>
