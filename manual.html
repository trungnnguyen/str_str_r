<h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
<p> For the issues on file format, refer to chapter 2. </p>
<p> Currently, there are two formats available. One of which is called
  'MTS' while the other is 'NIST'. Ths module str_str_r.py is, at first,
  created for analyzing the raw data files from the MTS system at GIFT.
  Later on, to cope with the raw file for the raw data files from NIST,
  mode 'NIST' was added. During the stay at NIST, the incremental angle
  for in-plane tensile bar decided to be 15 degree, which eventually led to
  far more number of files for one kind of material. Therefore, a different
  way of post-processing the data was necessary. On the other hand, the
  forcus was on the the in-plane variations of the r-value and the yield
  stress. Therefore, some additional features were necessary to look at
  such features more intensely and, at the same time, succintly. Error
  bar was also necessary to see how experimental scatter is like, which
  provide a systematic view on the aspects of both experiments and and
  modeling.

<p> File format: Either the csv from the NIST, or MTS files.
  In the NIST case, def nist_inplane can be used. </p>
<p><i> <!-- Below is an example -->
    >>> from str_str_r import nist_inplane as ni <br />
    >>> ni(ext ='*.csv', ifig=92, order=3, epsl=0.05,
    epsu=0.10, delt=10) <br />
</i></p>

<h2> 2. Raw data file format</h2>
<p> NIST mode is assumed to have three lines of header.
  Example header as below: </p>
<p><font color='gray'> Time,Extension,Load,Displacement (Strain 1),
  Displacement (Strain 2) <br />
  (sec),(mm),(N),(mm),(mm) <br />
  12.6, 1.2 <br /> . <br /> . <br /> . <br />
</font></p>
<p> The last row contains two numbers,
  each of which contains the width and the thickness,
  respectively. </p>
